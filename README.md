## Project Background and Proposal

Over the years, coroutine has been introduced into various languages including Kotlin and Python and is implemented in different degree of expressiveness for different purposes. Its popularity in asynchronous programming shows the coroutine benefits some kind of applications and some model of programming. In c++20, coroutine is released in the standard library, we are going to research about how powerful coroutine in c++20 would be in high performance programming. We propose that the coroutine feature of the C++20 would introduce more flexibility or concurrency into shared memory or distributed memory programming and the concurrency introduced would lead to better performance, more readability of the code, and easier programming style. We would test on a range of programs of different performance requirements and research about to which level would cpp20 coroutine support task based programming paradigm and whether it would bring more support for performance-stressed programs.
