# Fourth meeting

Date: 2022-04-05 15:00

Present: Tianyi (TX), Rupe (RWN)

## Discussion

- Be more specific on the terminology: subroutine is a subset of coroutine where subroutine only have one entry point and coroutine have multiple entry points
- Should be careful about the generic coroutine and the one the cpp20 implemented
- Add workflow chart to explain the coawait operator
- Should cite properly
- Summary about the benchmark of the TAMPI
- Move the PRK mini-apps to the background
- Coawait on the request 
- Work plan should be written with work streams, divided into small tasks where each takes about one week on average: implementing, testing, and writing up reports. Writing the report could take up 2 weeks
- It is a novice for me and the cpp coroutine would so it would be good to blog my experience and it might be good to refer to afterwards
- The implementation of the COMPI would be polling on the request of MPI in the caller with MPI_waitany and once any request is done, the control could be transferred back to the coroutine
- Some of the questions in the previous dissertations are not answered and it is fair for the dissertation to say that it has done its research though it might not be interesting, it is still a partial success
- The core hour would be about 500 to 1000 coue hours, because most of my job would be comparably small and it might be on the debug queue. Towards the end of this project, it might scale up on less than two hundred cores. Compare with how TAMPI scaled.
- In the proposal, the core of the research problem need to be addressed
- In the report, do something about the code syntax, and make it highlighted. sequence, listings
- My implementation would be more about the promise, awaiter and executer
- Finding the libraries is important because I would then be able to leave the detail of implementaing the promise type, the return object to the library
