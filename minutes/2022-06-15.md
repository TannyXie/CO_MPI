Present: Tianyi (TX), Rupe (RWN)

## Discussion

- HPX executor is not usable. Folly executor is usable.
- For the sketched user side code, task number can be in the first draft of the code but it is better to hide it.
- It should be decided that if the executor corresponds to one or more communicator. 
- one executor should be running at a time but multiple executors should be allowed to exist. 
- All the code later will be written with template.
- Should decide on whether to distinguish the task that would return a value with the task that don't return a value.
- The co_mpi send and recv won't need an MPI communicator because there should be one in the member variable.
